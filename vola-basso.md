# Vola basso
Vola basso (fly low) is a twist on the *"Alta Quota"* (High altitude)  cocktail [from distilleria Alpe](https://www.alpevda.it/alta-quota/)

The original recipe calls for:

- 3 cl Herbetet Genepy
- 2 cl Pear flavoured Grey Goose Vodka
- 1 cl Amaro di Angostura (beware: this is not the angostura bitter, it's a different product)
- 1 cl St Germain
- 2 cl lime juice
- 6 cl apple juice 

Since not all of these ingredients are handy to have around at home, I've made a twist to use more common ingredients instead.

- 3 cl Genepy
- 2 cl Vodka (pretty much any vodka, it's just to get higher alcol content. Skip for lower alcohol content)
- 2 dashes of Angostura bitter
- 1 cl elderflowers syrup
- 2 cl lime juice (one lime?)
- 6 cl apple juice 



The ingredients are stirred with ice in a mixing glass and strained in an old fashioned glass with ice.
