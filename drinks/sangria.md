# Sangria

**Disclaimer #1:** This is the version of Sangria I like. By no means is this intended to be the _original_ or the _best_ sangria. If you don't like it, drink something else :)

**Disclaimer #2:** This recipe comes from this [website](https://www.misya.info/ricetta/sangria.htm), and it is reported here with minor comments and a translation. All the credits to the original author(s).

## Info
This recipe, with the described quantities, yields about 2.5L of liquid. The total volume will be larger as the fruit will take up some space. Be prepared!

## Ingredients for about 2.5L
- 1.5L Tavernello if you are in Italy, or Spanish red wine if you can find it. If you cannot find either, use some light and cheap red wine.
- 750ml Sprite or Gassosa
- 50ml brandy or rum. I usually go for a French-style rum or cacha√ßa.
- 1 lemon
- 2 oranges
- 2 yellow peaches
- 2 apples
- 50g sugar
- 1 vanilla bean
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 cloves (_chiodi di garofano_ for the Italian peeps, I am saving you one Google Translate)

## Instructions

1. Wash and peel the peaches and apples, then cut them into small cubes.
2. Place the chopped fruit in a bowl, add the sugar and the liquor, mix well, and let it marinate for 1 hour.
3. Rinse and scrub the lemon and oranges, then slice them thinly.
4. Place the citrus slices in a large bowl and add the spices (vanilla bean, cinnamon stick, and cloves).
5. Add the gassosa and wine to the citrus and let it rest for 1 hour.
6. Remove the spices and add the marinated fruit.
7. Place the sangria in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving.

Enjoy your homemade Sangria!
