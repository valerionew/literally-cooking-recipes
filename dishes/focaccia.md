# Focaccia
This recipe is for focaccia, but if you substitute the salamoia with tomato sauce, you can make pizza (milanese style). This recipe requires 24 hours of rest in the fridge and two hours rest in the baking tray, so plan ahead. 

This recipe is for two 30x40cm trays, that will feed 6-8 people or 4 hungry people.

## Ingredients
- 1000g high protein flour (12-14% protein). You can use something like W270 or a mixture of 70% W270 and 30% W350. **If you are lost at this indication, don't worry**, just use a flour with high protein content, typically pizza flour.
- 550g water
- 40g extra virgin olive oil
- 23g salt
- 10g fresh yeast in summer, 15g in winter (because of the ambient temperature)

### Salamoia OR pizza topping
For focaccia you make salamoia:
- 100g water
- 100g extra virgin olive oil
- 10g salt

For pizza you make tomato sauce:
- 500g tomato sauce
- 50g extra virgin olive oil
- 10g salt
- Mozzarella (**fior di latte**)

## Directions

1) Put the flour in a bowl;
1) Dissolve the yeast in ambient temperature water;
1) Add the water to the flour and mix until the water is absorbed;
1) Add the oil slowly and the salt and mix until the oil is absorbed;
1) Knead the dough for 10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic;
1) Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rest for 30 minutes, at room temperature in winter, in the fridge in summer;
1) After the rest, divide the dough in two (you should consider 0.5-0.6g per cm^2 of tray, two parts is a good approximation for two 30x40cm tray);
1) Put each part in a separate container, cover with film and let it rest in the fridge at 4C for 24 hours or not less than 16-18h. Expect the dough to double or triple in size, so use a container that can accomodate that;
1) After the rest, take the dough out of the fridge and let it rest at room temperature for some minutes;
1) Oil the trays just enough to cover the bottom and the sides, you can use a brush or your hands. Do not use too much oil;
1) Put the dough in the trays and spread it with your hands or a rolling pin, until it covers the whole tray. If the dough is too elastic and springs back, let it rest for 10 minutes and try again;
1) Let the dough rest for 45 minutes, covered with a damp cloth. This is just half of the rest. In this phase, it can stay in warm place, but not too warm, 25-30C is good;
1) After the first rest, make the holes with your fingers, until you reach the bottom of the tray. If you are making pizza, spread the tomato sauce. If you are making focaccia, spread the salamoia. The salamoia should fill the holes completely, use a brush to spread it evenly;
1) Let the dough rest for another 45 minutes, uncovered. This is the second half of the rest. 
1) Preheat the oven at 250C;
1) Put the trays in the oven and bake for 10 minutes in the middle of the oven.
1) If you are making pizza, take the trays out of the oven and spread the mozzarella on top of the tomato sauce. Put the trays back in the oven and bake for another 3 minutes, until the mozzarella is melted but not browned.
1) If you are making focaccia, put the tray in the top of the oven and bake for another 2 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
1) Take the trays out of the oven and let the focaccia/pizza rest for 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
1) Enjoy!
