# Pastiera cake

## Step 0: ingredients for 2-3 cakes
- 3 rolls of pasta frolla (*short pastry?*): 2 for the cakes and 1 for decoration 
- 550g grano cotto (cooked wheat)
- 100g milk
- 30g butter
- 100g cedro candito (or not, i don't use it)
- 700g **sheep** ricotta
- 450g white sugar
- 7 eggs: 5 whole eggs + 2 egg reds
- lemon peel from one lemon (in big pieces)
- 1 flask of acqua di fiori d'arancio (85ml typically) **or** 2 small vials of aroma di fiori d'arancio (orange blossom aroma?)
- 1 vial of vanilla flavour or 1 sachet of vanillin
- Some cinnamon (or not)

## Step 1: heat the wheat
Heat the cooked wheat with the milk and the lemon peel in a pot for ~10 minutes.  
Turn off the heat and remove the lemon peel. Let everything cool.

## Step 2: blend the ricotta with the sugar
Blend the ricotta cheese with the sugar, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Beware, this thing is delicious.

## Step 3: egg the eggs
In a bowl put the eggs, for two of the seven use only the reds. Add the cinnamon, the acqua di fiori d'arancio and the vanilla flavour. Make the compound homogeneous. 

## Step 4: mix!
Mix the three compounds: the wheat, the ricotta and the eggs.

## Step 5: prepare the baking pans
Pastiera is traditionally prepared in round baking pans. Put some baking paper in the pans and roll out the dough. Pour the mixture in the dough.

## Step 6: decorate
Pastiera is traditionally decorated with pasta frolla strips on top. Someone says they have to be a certain amount to respect the ⓣⓡⓐⓓⓘⓣⓘⓞⓝ. You decide

## Step 7: cook
180°C in the oven, for 1 hour.

## Step 8: WAIT!!!
Pastiera needs to rest for a day or two before being eaten. Wait! :D
